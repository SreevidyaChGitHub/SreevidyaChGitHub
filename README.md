I am a Software Engineer having experience in the development of Web-based and Windows-based applications
using .NET Technologies with SQL Server as a database in the backend.

<h2>üë®‚Äçüíª Professional Experience:</h2>

- <b>Talousvirta & Resonia applications</b>
Talousvirta is an invoice service which is an electric service that helps the registered customers in 
customer creation, product creation, raise invoices and having payment control. It provides the 
funding service as well if the customer needs one. 
Resonia is a debt collection service which is an electric service, where you can follow your 
receivables situation and create new debt collection assignments easily from the application itself.
User interfaces of both the applications are developed using React which makes calls to the web API 
services which in turn communicate with the backend for the processing.
